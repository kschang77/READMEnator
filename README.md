# READMEnator

A good README generator

Need to use Github API to pull pix and email (if setup)

API Documentation https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/getting-started/

https://developer.github.com/v3/users/

Then it's a matter of pulling the various bits as templates.

And run it through Markdown generator.
