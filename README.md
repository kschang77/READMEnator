  A Command-line-interface (CLI) with Node.js to generate a decent README. Not very smart, but it'll do the job, or at least get you started.

## Code Snippet

This is the main program. Proper use of async then. yourREADME.md was chosen because I don't want the app to overwrite this README.md, right? 

```
 askQuestions().then(function (result) {
    var ret = result
    doProcessing(ret).then(function (ret2) {
      var ret3 = Object.assign(ret, ret2)
      var procData = generateMarkdown(ret3)
      writeToFile("yourREADME.md", procData)
      console.info("yourREADME.md has been written to app directory. ")
    })
  })
  }
```
  
## Stretch Goals / Future Developement

Can probably make it smarter by reading package.json files and fancier input choices, like let user pick from all the repos they have, and so on. Then let them pick a license? Then search for badges, maybe?
